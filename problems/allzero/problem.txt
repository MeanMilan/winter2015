Write a program that exports a function that,
given an undefined number of arguments as Number
return true if all are zero.
The program must be less then 140 character!

  module.exports = function(arguments) { ... }

Save that code into a file, YOUR_PROGRAM.js (you can name it whatever you like)
and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.
