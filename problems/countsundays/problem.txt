How many Sundays fell on the first of the month
during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

Write a module that return this count.

  module.exports = countSundays()

Save that code into a file, YOUR_PROGRAM.js (you can name it whatever you like)
and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND run YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to run your program.
